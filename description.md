In this project, Account Abstraction from Scratch (AA from Scratch), I make adjustments to my project to include a Bundler, deploy the Account Factory and Paymaster contracts on Arbitrum Sepolia, and update the User Operation execute script to post transactions to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet. 

There were a few gotcha's in this part that I didn't initially expect. After completing this project and seeing my mistakes, it should be clear to you why using Account Kit is the easiest way for you get started using Account Abstraction in your apps today!
